It is easily recognizable by its reddish-orange coat with dark stripes, with the exception of the white tiger, which is white with dark stripes. A tiger can weigh over 700 pounds and be six feet long with a three-foot long tail. Their natural habitat is eastern and southern Asia. They live where there is dense vegetation with a close proximity to water and an abundance of prey such as antelope and deer, taking down their prey with their retractable claws, strong body, and powerful jaws. Tigers are strong swimmers and enjoy bathing and cooling in ponds, rivers, and lakes. Tigers communicate by roaring, moaning, hissing, growling, and chuffing. Females mate and have a litter of three to four cubs. The cubs are born blind and helpless and cared for by their mothers in their den. At eight weeks they begin to follow the mother out of the den, becoming independent around 18 months of age and leaving their mother at around 2 years old. Tigers have a lifespan of 10 to 15 years but can live longer than 20 years, especially in captivity. \n\nHouse Cats (Domestic Cats) \n\nDomestic or house cat fur can be long or short in a variety of colors and patterns. As their name indicates, they are domesticated and generally live in companionship with a human and are found around the world. House cats range in size from 11 pounds to 25 pounds, depending on their breed. Most house cats eat a diet of commercial cat food but may supplement their diet with mice or birds that they stalk and capture. Like tigers and other large cats, the domestic cat also has retractable claws and powerful jaws for their size. Domestic cats do not like to bathe or cool themselves in water. Cats communicate by meowing, growling, hissing, and purring. Females mate and have a litter of three to five kittens that are born blind and helpless. Females wean their kittens between six and seven weeks of age, with the kittens able to go to a new home at 12 weeks. The lifespan of a domestic cat is between 10 and 14 years. \n\nBased on the two paragraphs, the way domestic cats and tigers are alike are:","grade":[5,6,7,8],"level":"D","subject":"English","topic":"Reading","subTopic":"Reading Comprehension Strategies","subSubTopic":"Comparing and Contrasting Characters","options":["They both live in the wild and hunt for their own food.","They both commonly live with human companions and have retractable claws.","They both communicate by growling and hissing and have retractable claws.","They both like to cool themselves in water."],"correct_answer":"They both communicate by growling and hissing and have retractable claws.","desc":"They both communicate by growling and hissing and have retractable claws.","classification":"Text"},{"id":"mgIHH9GPCMnzW2aX63gz","ques":"There are 25 spokes in the national flag of India.
